    <h1>About</h1>

    <p><strong>Web Audio Recognizer</strong> (<strong>WAR</strong>) is a simple web page that allow you to recognize unknown music tracks and get the associated artist and title. Think about a Chazam, but web-based.</p>

    <p>You can either submit an audio file or capture / sing the music via your microphone, or even capture the music currently playing from your speakers (a little bit of configuration is needed for this, see <a href="#">in the FAQ</a>).</p>

    <h2>Author and genesis</h2>

    <p><strong>WAR</strong> was created by <a href="http://www.epoc.fr/">Epoc</a>. He primarly created it for himself, because he was frustated that <a href="http://www.di.fm/">Digitally Imported</a> - a great web radio he listen for years - often play tracks that are mixes. Since mixes are several tracks mixed together in one huge track, you can't get the real tracks name.</p>
    <p>As he uses several methods at several places to listen to DI, he wanted a system that didn't need to install anything (other than a modern web browser).</p>
    <p>He also needed that this system searches several audio databases in one time to maximize the chances to get positive matches.</p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>

    <p><strong>WAR</strong> is rolling on <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>) and <a href="https://nginx.org/">Nginx</a>. It also uses <a href="http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/">Beanstalk</a>, <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a> and <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>.</p>

    <p>It request the following audio databases for each requests:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://acoustid.org/">AcoustID</a> (complete audio files only)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.acrcloud.com/">ACRCloud</a></li>
    </ul>
