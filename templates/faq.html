    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <p>Please check here if your question has already been answered. There's nothing more frustrating than having to answer the same question again and again, trust me.</p>
    <p>If you are sure that your question isn't listed here, throw me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/EpocDotFr">on Twitter</a>.</p>

        <li><a href="">How to capture the output from my speakers?</a></li>
        <li><a href="">It is open-source?</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Do I need to install some crap?</h2>

    <p>Nothing to install. The only requirement is a modern web browser. If you're still on Internet Explorer 7 or similar and you're experiencing issues, please either use a real web browser or go back to your middle of nowhere.</p>

    <h2>How to capture the output from my speakers?</h2>

    <p>You have to create a fake recording peripheral (usually called stereo mix) that will be accessed by <strong>WAR</strong> like if it's a microphone.</p>

    <h2>It is open-source?</h2>

    <p>Nope. I don't think I will open-source it because it doesn't provide any technically meaningful matter to the community.</p>
