    <h2 id="need-install-crap">Do I need to install some crap to make it working?</h2>

    <p>No. The only requirement is a modern web browser.</p>
    <p>If you're still on Internet Explorer 7 or similar and you're experiencing issues, please either use a real web browser or go back to your middle of nowhere :)</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-capture-speakers">How to capture the output from my speakers?</h2>

    <p>You have to create a fake recording peripheral (usually called "stereo mix") that will be accessed by <strong>WAR</strong> as if it were a microphone.</p>

    <h2 id="open-source">It is open-source?</h2>

    <p>Nope. I don't think I will open-source it because it doesn't provide any technically meaningful matter to the community.</p>

    <h2 id="works-mobile-devices">Is WAR working on mobile devices?</h2>

    <p>Yes. Again, any modern mobile web browser will be OK.</p>
    
    <h2 id="why-use-war">Why would I use WAR instead of other services?</h2>
    
    <p>The <strong>WAR</strong> final goal isn't different from other services (getting the track name of and audio sample), but the way it's achieved is. The <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}#author-genesis">About</a> page has more informations about how <strong>WAR</strong> works.</p>

    <h2 id="privacy-data-sent">What about my privacy and the data I send to WAR?</h2>

    <p>See on the <a href="{{ url_for('tos') }}">terms of service</a> page. Don't worry, there isn't any incomprehensible bullshit written on this page.</p>
